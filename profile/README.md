# :ghost: Hello there

<br />

Welcome to **ceit-aut** where I represent all of the projects that I have done at 
Faculty of Computer Engineering and Information Technology **Amirkabir University of Terhran**, Iran.
These are the courses that I took at CEIT.

The naming rule for repositories goes as follow ```S[semester number][course name][project number]```, so you can
search through them easily.
